# PythonProjects
This repository contains python projects I am working on to practice and further my skills as a Python programmer. I am currently using LinkedIn Learning modules to develop more skills in Python and work on interesting projects. Some of these projects will be copied over to seperate repositories once completed.

# TerminalScribe
The goal of this project was to take a refresher course on some Python fundamentals. This particular project is part of the LinkedIn Python Essential Training by Ryan Mitchell. Course content covered the basics of Python (data structures, functions, control flow, classes and objects). 

What I learned:
- f-strings, 
- parent and child classes 
- error and exception handling 
- custome exceptions
- threads (multi-threading)
- processes (multi-processing)

# Snake Game
I implemented the classic snake game in Python to become more familiar with the built-in Turtle package and its visualizer. The code for the snake game is located in the Snake directory. Python 3.6 or higher is required to run the snake game. Use "python3 run_snake.py" to play the game, and use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.

What I learned:
- Using Turtle to construct game-like environments and visualizers
- Lambda functions
